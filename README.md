# Desenvolvimento_Rapido_Em_Python
Practical activities from college classes on rapid development in Python.

In this course, we will learn how to use rapid development using Python. In its first class (devrappy), we learned to install and covered some basic concepts of **Pandas**, such as creating a dictionary, creating a data frame, and manipulating that data frame. It's worth noting that all of this was done through the Colab platform.

In the second class (dev_rap_py2), we installed pandas-profiling to learn how to work with a dataset. In this class, we used the Titanic accident dataset, reading it in the .csv format. We then generated insights from the Titanic dataset using pandas-profiling.
